* TITLE: DS 290: Modelling and Simulation
* AUTHOR: Piyush Kumar

This repository contains lecture notes and summaries for *DS 290: Modelling and Simulation (August 2025)*, based on the book *Discrete-Event System Simulation* by Jerry Banks, Carson, Nelson & Nicol.

* üìò Topics Covered

- Empirical distributions

*** Queueing Models
- Components: server, customer, arrival, queue discipline
- Markovian queues, multiserver queues
- Performance metrics: utilization, delay
- \( L = \lambda W \) formula

** Random Number & Variate Generation
- Linear Congruential Method (LCM)
- Acceptance-Rejection technique
- Inverse transform
- Thinning method for NSPP

** Input Modeling
